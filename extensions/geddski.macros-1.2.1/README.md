## Create Custom Macros

Create your own custom macros by adding them to your `settings.json` (Code|File > Preferences > User Settings)

For example:

```json
"macros": {
    "commentDown": [
        "editor.action.copyLinesDownAction",
        "cursorUp",
        "editor.action.addCommentLine",
        "cursorDown"
    ]
}
```

This macro creates a copy of the current line, comments out the original line, and moves the cursor down to the copy.

Your macros can run any built-in VS Code action, and even actions from other extensions. 
To see all the names of possible actions VS Code can run, see `Default Keyboard Shortcuts` (Code|File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts) 

Give your macros names that briefly describe what they do.

## Add Keybindings to Run your Macros

in `keybindings.json` (Code|File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts) add bindings to your macros:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+cmd+/",
  "command": "macros.commentDown"
}
```

Notice that `macros.my_macro_name` has to match what you named your macro. 

## Passing Arguments to Commands

Many commands accept arguments, like the "type" command which lets you insert text into the editor. For these cases use an object instead of a string when specifying the command to call in your `settings.json`:

```json
"macros": {
  "addSemicolon": [
    "cursorEnd",
      {"command": "type", "args": {"text": ";"}}
  ]
}
```

## Executing Snippets as part of a Macro

Macros can also execute any of your snippets which is super neat. Just insert the same text that you would normally type for the snippet, followed by the `insertSnippet` command:

```json
"macros": {
  "doMySnippet": [
    {"command": "type", "args": {"text": "mySnippetPrefixHere"}},
    "insertSnippet"
  ]
}
```

So for example I have a JavaScript snippet for logging an object (`javascript.json`):

```json
{
  "Print object to console": {
		"prefix": "con",
		"body": [
			"console.log('$1', $1);$2"
		],
		"description": "console.log an object"
	}
}
```

And I have a macro that will select the word at my cursor, copy it, drop to a new line, and run that snippet to log the variable:

editor.action.addSelectionToNextFindMatch

```json
"macros": {
  "logCurrentVariable": [
    "editor.action.addSelectionToNextFindMatch",
    "problems.action.copy",
    
      {"command": "type", "args": {"text": "con"}}
  ]
}
```

## Known Issues

Doesn't currently add macros to command pallete (have to use keybindings).
